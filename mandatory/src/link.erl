%% @doc Process link tutorial. When a link is setup
%% between two processes and one of the two processes terminates, the other
%% process automatically terminates with the same reason. Behind the scenes, the
%% Erlang runtime sends an exit signal to terminate the linked process. A
%% process that traps the exit signal will receive a special exit message
%% instead of terminating when a linked process terminates.
